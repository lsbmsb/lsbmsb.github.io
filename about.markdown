Hi, 
I am [Mahesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahesh-bhosale-570468aa/). I currently work as software engineer at [Veritas](https://www.veritas.com/).

I write about technical stuff that I am onto. I maintain my physical writings whenever required, but recent lock-downs due to COVID-19 have taught me importance of
HA (high availability) of the NOTES. My notes were stuck at my apartment in Pune while I needed it the most at my hometown. So one of the motivations for starting this blog is a easy accessibility. But I think the most important one is to "Learn and Let learn".

 &nbsp;Am I sitting in a tin can \
 &nbsp;Far above the world \
 &nbsp;Planet Earth is blue \
 &nbsp;And there's nothing I can do.*
