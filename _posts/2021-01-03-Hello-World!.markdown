Hello you,

This is the first post in this blog, just playing with `jekyll`. I have kept, for now, most of the default things that come with `jekyll`, but plan to learn it in depth to have a nice customized theme. Let's see how that goes.

oh, I have been wanting to write this for long, glad that I started now.
I will be using this platform to write technical stuff. 

At the time of writing this post, I am interested in the concepts of ML/DL/AI, more in their theoretical foundations to sufficiently understand the concepts. Also, for some things I might also have hands on. Professionally, I also have an experience in the kernel programming and debugging, specifically in the areas of file system, so I might as well post some kernel related stuff sporadically if not ever.

Wish me luck!!

GOD SPEED.
